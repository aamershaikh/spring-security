     *Basic Auth in Spring boot*
     - There are multiple ways to authenticate our RESTful web services. 
     The basic way is to use basic authentication. In the basic authentication, we send a username and password as part of our request. When we provide a username and password, it allows us to access the resource.
     - client sends a get request along with base 64 username:password, server sends a 200 status.
     without the username and password the resource is not accessible.
     - within the browser we get the username and passowrd pop up.
